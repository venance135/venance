<h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
   We have started this youth reform based on talents uplifting to reduce the rate of parents to leave alone the habit of focusing
	 much and depending on education of africa but to allow their children to get toshow to the talent ,ability and
	 express their talents to the world through different sector that maty be like football,netball leadership skills,acting and so forth
  Africa’s total  population with an estimated 75% of the continent’s  population below the age of 35. From a demographic  point of view, 
   this calls for a paradigm shift towards  the recognition and support of the youth to harness  their potential by building capacity for quality
   education and skills improvement, health and well-  being, good governance, human rights and  accountability, employment opportunities,empowerment
   entrepreneurship and leadership skills. 
   <br   />
   <br  /> 
   <br  />
    <br  />

 This is the basis for the  prioritization of youth development by The talent reform.
   The Talent reform is a not-for proﬁt youth organization  incorporated in Tanzania.
   <br  />
   <br  />
 <br  /> 
 <br  />
 The Talent reform is non proﬁt making and all its  ﬁnances go directly to its youth empowerment  programs.
 Our strategy has always been to look at  today's youth bulge as an opportunity for  development and economic growth,
  This is we lead organisation towards implementing a broad range  of personal and professional development programs   
   among others.
   <br  />
 To date,our aim is to expand the youth epowerement towards their talents and 
  attracted major partners such as IFAD, USAID, Ford Foundation, MasterCard  Foundation, and Google internationally.

Does having a learning disability mean that you can’t learn? Eight children prove that the answer is a definitive “No” in this HBO Family documentary 
that takes an enlightening look at young people with a wide spectrum of learning differences. Interviews with kids and parents are intercut with 
scenes of the children engaged in activities that reflect their talents–painting, poetry, etc. This 30-minute documentary takes an enlightening
 look at young people with a wide spectrum of learning differences; offering a compelling portrait of the ways in which these children are able
 to compensate by using their strengths to overcome their challenges.

From the Executive Producer, Sheila Nevins, and the director and producer, Ellen Goosenberg Kent of “I Have Tourette’s but
 Tourette’s Doesn’t Have Me,” this documentary is an inspiring account of children with learning differences who have discovered
 real abilities, and have learned to use their strengths to 
overcome their learning struggles
